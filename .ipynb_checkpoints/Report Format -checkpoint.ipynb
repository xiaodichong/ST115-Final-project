    " - There was no missing data for any of the entries. However, due to the way the subjects were sorted, we used the most precise definition of subject to identify each subjet. For example, we did not use data for 'Mathematical Sciences', and instead used data for 'Mathematics' and 'Statistics' seperately.\n",

    "After some EDA, we filtered the data to only include data on undergraduates students in full-time study. Following this, we sorted the subjects to include only specific subject studies (such as mathematics), instead of overarching subject titles (such as Mathematical Sciences). The specific subject codes were noted to have been of the form CAH00-00-00 where the 0 entries could take any numerical value, hence they were sorted as such. Some of the EDA is shown below, with the rest being accessible in the positivity.ipynb notebook."
